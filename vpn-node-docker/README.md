Sentinel dVPN OpenVPN Node Hosting
===

This is a complete guide to enable a configure use the Sentinel dVPN OpenVPN Node on Linux with docker and share unused bandwidth to the Sentinel Network.

Setup Instructions
===

Here are the steps involved in getting a Sentinel dVPN OpenVPN Node up and running:

1. Install docker
2. Build / pull the **Sentinel dVPN** docker image
3. Configure Node


Installing the latest version of docker in Ubuntu or Debian based releases
---

Below are the instructions on installing docker:

1. Install required dependencies to get docker installation script from get.docker.com

    `sudo apt install -y curl`

    `curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o /tmp/get-docker.sh`

2. Run the downloaded script to setup & install docker

    `sudo sh /tmp/get-docker.sh`

3. Add current user to the docker group to give required access

   `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

Running the Sentinel dVPN Node
---

You can setup and run VPN node in two ways:

1. Quick Run - download docker image from Docker Hub
2. DIY - build your own docker image from the Sentinel code repository

### Method #1 [Download docker image from Docker Hub]

1. Navigate to the User's home directory

    `cd ~`

2. Create a new folder to pull the docker image and run it

    `mkdir -p $HOME/.sentinel`
    
3. Pull the official Sentinel docker image from Docker Hub & configure the node

    `sudo docker run -it --privileged --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.sentinel,target=/root/.sentinel -p 3000:3000 -p 1194:1194/udp sentinelofficial/sentinel-vpn-node`

### Method #2 [Build Your Own Docker Image]

Do-it-Yourself setup by building your own docker image

1. Navigate to the root folder or anywhere that you want to setup the project and download code from the repository

    `cd ~`
2. Clone the Sentinel repository

    `git clone https://github.com/sentinel-official/sentinel.git`

3. Navigate to the folder with code to build the docker image

    `cd ~/sentinel/vpn-node-docker`

4. Build the docker image

    `sudo docker build --file Dockerfile.prod --tag sentinel-vpn-node --force-rm --no-cache .`

5. Navigate to the folder where the docker container was setup. In our case it is the User's home directory.

    `mkdir -p $HOME/.sentinel`

6. Run the image and configure the node

    `sudo docker run -it --privileged --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.sentinel,target=/root/.sentinel -p 3000:3000 -p 1194:1194/udp sentinel-vpn-node`

Updating an existing Sentinel dVPN OpenVPN Node
===

1. Pull the latest version of docker

    `sudo docker pull sentinelofficial/sentinel-vpn-node`

2. Stop the existing version of docker

    `sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -a -q --filter="ancestor=sentinelofficial/sentinel-vpn-node")`
    
    ###### Note: The Sentinel dVPN Node must be stopped to be removed, otherwise you should use a -f flag to forcefuly remove the Node

3. Remove the older version of docker

    `sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q --filter="ancestor=sentinelofficial/sentinel-vpn-node")`

After running the above commands please follow the insturctions on either Method #1 Medthod #2 to get the node up and running again.

Helpful docker commands to interact with the Sentinel dVPN Node
===

*  list a running Sentinel dVPN Node: 

    ```sudo docker ps```

* list both, running and stopped Sentinel dVPN Nodes:

    ```sudo docker ps -a```
    
* stop a particular Sentinel Node:

    * run ```sudo docker ps``` and copy the Container ID.
    * run ```sudo docker stop ContainerID```
 
     ###### Note: stopping a dVPN Node does not remove the container
 
* remove a particular Sentinel dVPN Node:
    ```sudo docker rm ContainerID_OR_ContainerName```

    ###### Note: The Sentinel dVPN Node must be stopped to be removed. Alternatively, you can use the `-f` flag to forcefully remove the Node if the node can not be stopped.

* remove node using the force option `-f`:

    ```sudo docker rm -f ContainerID_OR_ContainerName```

* remove all stopped Sentinel dVPN Nodes:

    ```sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)```
    
* stop all the running dVPN Nodes and remove them:

    ```sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -a -q) && sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)```
